            You will not upload, post, discuss, request, or link to anything
            that violates local or United States law.

            All boards on Cheddit are to be considered &quot;work safe.&quot; Do
            not post anything that would be unacceptable in a professional
            setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will not post or request personal information (&quot;dox&quot;)
            or calls to invasion (&quot;raids&quot;). Inciting or participating
            in cross-board (intra-Cheddit) raids is also not permitted.
          </li>
          <li>No spamming or flooding of any kind. </li>
          <li>
            Advertising (all forms) is not welcomeâ€”this includes any type of
            referral linking, &quot;offers&quot;, soliciting, begging, stream
            threads, etc.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These rules apply to all boards. Individual boards may have additional
          rules that are more strict, but none can violate any global rule.

          Remember: The use of Cheddit is a privilege, not a right. The site
          admin reserves the right to revoke access and remove content for any
          reason without notice.
