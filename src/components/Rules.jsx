        <li>
          You will not upload, post, discuss, request, or link to anything that
          violates local or United States law.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will immediately cease and not continue to access the site if you
          are under the age of 18.
        </li>
        <li>
          All boards on Cheddit are to be considered &quot;work safe.&quot; Do
          not post anything that would be unacceptable in a professional
          setting.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will not post or request personal information (&quot;dox&quot;) or
          calls to invasion (&quot;raids&quot;). Inciting or participating in
          cross-board (intra-Cheddit) raids is also not permitted.
        </li>
        <li>No spamming or flooding of any kind. </li>
        <li>
          Advertising (all forms) is not welcomeâ€”this includes any type of
          referral linking, &quot;offers&quot;, soliciting, begging, stream
          threads, etc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These rules apply to all boards. Individual boards may have additional
        rules that are more strict, but none can violate any global rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember: The use of Cheddit is a privilege, not a right. The site admin
        reserves the right to revoke access and remove content for any reason
        without notice.
